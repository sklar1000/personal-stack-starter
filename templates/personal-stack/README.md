## Setup Order

1. Create vault folder structure (see Builder's Guide)
2. Copy `CLAUDE-template.md` → vault root as `CLAUDE.md`
3. Copy `Objectives-template.md` → `01_Actions/Objectives.md`
4. Create first project with `Project-README-template.md`
5. Create `.claude/commands/` folder
6. Copy command files to `.claude/commands/`
7. Copy `Governance-Rules-template.md` → `00_Operations/`

## Customization

**CLAUDE.md**: Fill in your personal details, roles, objectives. The more context, the better AI collaboration.

**Commands**: These are starting points. Modify as you develop your workflow.

**Governance**: Start with these rules. Adjust based on what actually causes problems.
