# [Domain] Ontology

Core concepts and definitions for [domain].

**Purpose**: Establish shared vocabulary so frameworks and processes have clear foundations.

---

## Primitive Concepts

These are the atoms everything else builds from.

### [Concept 1]

**Definition**: [Clear, one-sentence definition]

**Examples**:
- [Concrete example 1]
- [Concrete example 2]

**Not to be confused with**: [Common misunderstanding or similar-sounding concept]

---

### [Concept 2]

**Definition**: [Clear, one-sentence definition]

**Examples**:
- [Concrete example 1]
- [Concrete example 2]

**Not to be confused with**: [Common misunderstanding]

---

### [Concept 3]

**Definition**: [Clear, one-sentence definition]

**Examples**:
- [Concrete example 1]
- [Concrete example 2]

**Not to be confused with**: [Common misunderstanding]

## Concept Relationships

How concepts connect to each other:

| Concept A | Relationship | Concept B |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| [Concept 1] | produces | [Concept 2] |
| [Concept 2] | requires | [Concept 3] |
| [Concept 3] | is a type of | [Concept 1] |

## The Transformation Ladder

How raw inputs become outputs in this domain:

```
[Raw Input / Evidence]
        ↓ extract
[Primitives / Claims]
        ↓ structure
[Organized Records]
        ↓ synthesize
[Maps / Models]
        ↓ apply
[Actions / Artifacts]
```

### Layer Details

**[Raw Input]**: [What you start with - stories, data, observations]

**[Primitives]**: [Extracted atomic units - claims, skills, values]

**[Records]**: [Structured collections - registers, ledgers, logs]

**[Maps]**: [Synthesized views - snapshots, models, summaries]

**[Actions]**: [Applied outputs - decisions, artifacts, next steps]

## Glossary

Quick reference for all terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| [Term 1] | [Short definition] |
| [Term 2] | [Short definition] |
| [Term 3] | [Short definition] |

## Anti-Confusions

Common misunderstandings to prevent:

1. **"[Concept A] is the same as [Concept B]"** — No, because [explanation]
2. **"You need [X] before [Y]"** — Actually, [clarification]
3. **"[Term] means [wrong thing]"** — In this canon, it means [correct definition]
