# What's a Personal Stack? (The Non-Technical Version)

## The problem you probably have

You've tried productivity apps. Maybe a lot of them. You set them up, use them for a few months, then slowly stop. Not because you're lazy—because maintaining the system becomes another job on top of your actual job.

Meanwhile, you're using AI (ChatGPT, Claude, whatever) and it's helpful, but every conversation starts from scratch. It doesn't know what you're working on. It doesn't remember what you decided last week. You're constantly re-explaining context.

## What I built instead

I connected three things:
1. A place where all my notes, projects, and goals live (Obsidian—think fancy folders)
2. An AI that can actually read and write to that place (not just chat)
3. A system that tracks every change (like "undo" but for your whole work history)

When I start working, I type one command and the AI shows me: here are your three big goals, here's what you're focused on this week, here's what you did yesterday, here's what's stuck. I don't have to remember. The system remembers for me.

When I capture a task, it goes to the right project automatically. When I finish working, the system documents what happened. I'm not maintaining the system—the system maintains itself.

## Why this actually matters

Most people spend real mental energy on "where was I?" and "what should I work on?" and "I know I wrote something about this somewhere." That friction adds up. It's death by a thousand cuts.

This eliminates that friction. The AI knows my context because it can read my actual files. It doesn't give generic advice—it gives advice based on my specific projects, my patterns, my history.

The other thing: it shows me myself. Not in a journaling way—in a data way. I can see that I've been "thinking about" the same decision for 68 days without actually deciding. That's useful information.

## Who this is for

- People who do knowledge work (writing, teaching, consulting, building things)
- People who've tried multiple productivity systems and watched them all decay
- People who use AI but wish it knew more about what they're actually doing
- People who want their system to work as hard as they do

## What it's not

- An app you download
- Something you set up in a weekend
- A replacement for doing the actual work

It's infrastructure. Like a home office versus working from your couch. Takes effort to build, but then it compounds.
